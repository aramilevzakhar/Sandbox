AX (primary accumulator) - used for input / output and in most arithmetic operations. 
	For example, in a multiplication operation, 
	one operand is stored in the EAX / AX / AL register according to the size of the operand.

BX (base register) - used for indexed addressing.

CX (count register) - stores the number of cycles in repeated 
	operations (as well as registers ECX and CX).

DX (data register) - used in I / O operations, 
	as well as with the AX and DX registers to perform multiplication and division 
	operations associated with large values.
